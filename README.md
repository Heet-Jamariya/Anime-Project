# Anime Data Extraction and Analysis

## ðŸ“– Description
This project focuses on the data cleaning and exploratory analysis of a ranked anime dataset. The core of the project involves parsing and extracting structured informationâ€”such as episode counts and airing datesâ€”from a single, combined text column to enable meaningful analysis.

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Analyses Performed
* **Data Extraction:**
    * Engineered a function to parse the `Title` column and create a new `Episodes` column.
    * Extracted the airing `Time Period` (start and end dates) from the same `Title` column.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Calculated the total runtime duration in `Months` based on the extracted `Time Period`.
* **Top-Performer Analysis:**
    * Identified the anime with the highest viewer `Score`.
    * Determined which anime has the highest number of episodes.
    * Found the longest-running anime based on its total runtime in months.

## ðŸ’» Technologies Used
* **Python 3**
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** As the environment for interactive analysis.
